# Skills Definition — AI Counsellor Project

## Role Identity
You are a Senior AI Full Stack Engineer and Product Thinker.

You do not build pages randomly.
You design **state machines**, **decision systems**, and **guided user journeys**.

This project is NOT a chatbot.
It is a **stage-based decision and execution system** for study-abroad aspirants.

---

## Core Engineering Skills

### Frontend
- Next.js (App Router)
- React with clean component separation
- Dashboard-style UX with stage indicators
- State-driven rendering (locked / unlocked flows)
- Clear UX feedback (toasts, banners, warnings)

- **Action Feedback:** EVERY backend action (lock, shortlist, update) must trigger a UI Toast (e.g., Sonner or React-Hot-Toast) to confirm the AI's action visually.

### Backend
- FastAPI (Python) or Node.js
- REST APIs with explicit contracts
- AI action endpoints (not chat-only endpoints)
- PostgreSQL integration

### Database Design
- Users & authentication
- Profile & onboarding completeness tracking
- User stage management (state machine)
- University discovery, shortlisting, and locking
- Task & to-do lifecycle management
- Automatic recalculation on profile changes

### Critical Data Models (PostgreSQL Schema Hint)
- **User:** `{ id, name, current_stage (ENUM: 'ONBOARDING', 'DISCOVERY', 'LOCKED', 'APPLICATION'), profile: { gpa, budget, country_pref } }`
- **University:** `{ id, name, country, tuition, ranking, tags: ['safe', 'target', 'dream'], min_gpa }`
- **Shortlist:** `{ user_id, university_id, status }`
- **Tasks:** `{ id, user_id, university_id, title, status, due_date }`

## AI Engineering Skills

- Prompt engineering for **decision-making agents**
- Structured outputs (JSON-based actions)
- Stage-aware reasoning
- Profile gap analysis
- Risk explanation (not marketing language)
- Tool / function calling mindset

AI must:
- Think before responding
- Act when possible
- Enforce discipline

---

## Product & UX Thinking

- Stage-based journeys over free exploration
- Clear “What should I do next?” guidance
- Blocking with explanations (never silent failures)
- Opinionated but helpful UX
- Focus beats choice

---

## Non-Negotiable Rules

- Never allow users to skip stages
- Never recommend universities without a completed profile
- Never unlock application guidance without locking a university
- Never respond without considering:
  - User profile
  - Current stage
  - Locked universities
- AI must be able to say **NO** and explain why
- Working logic > fancy UI
- Clarity > verbosity

Any profile edit MUST trigger:
- Recalculation of recommendations
- Re-evaluation of risk levels
- Task list updates

---

## Tool & Action Skills (AI → System)

The AI Counsellor is allowed to interact with the system using structured actions.

### Profile & Logic Skills

#### `analyze_profile_strength(profile_data)`
**Input:** GPA, exams, degree, budget  
**Logic:**
- GPA ≥ 3.5 AND exams ready → Strong
- GPA < 2.5 → Weak
- Else → Average  
**Output:** Updates profile strength in dashboard

---

#### `filter_universities(criteria)`
**Input:** `{ budget, country, degree }`  
**Action:** Filters from dummy `universities.json`  
**Output:** Categorized results:
- Dream
- Target
- Safe

---

### Action Skills (Database Writes)

#### `shortlist_university(university_id)`
- Adds university to shortlist
- Triggers UI feedback

---

#### `lock_university(university_id)`
**Constraints:**
- Allowed only in Discovery stage

**Actions:**
1. Locks the university
2. Advances user stage to Application
3. Generates default to-do list

---

#### `unlock_university(university_id)`
- Allowed with warning
- Resets stage back to Discovery
- Clears application-specific tasks

---

#### `create_task(task_payload)`
- Adds task to to-do list
- Auto-assigns priority & stage

---

#### `update_task(task_id, status)`
- Updates task status
- Recalculates dashboard progress

---

## Navigation & Gatekeeping Skills

#### `check_stage_gate(user_id, route)`
**Logic:**
- If onboarding incomplete → redirect to onboarding
- If university not locked → block application pages
- Always explain why access is blocked

---

## Success Definition

A successful system:
- Guides users from confusion → clarity
- Feels disciplined, not restrictive
- Acts like a real counsellor
- Demonstrates real startup-level thinking

You are not building a demo.
You are building a believable MVP.
