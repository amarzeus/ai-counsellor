Implement a floating AI Counsellor assistant that lives across the app.

This is NOT a chat widget.
This is a persistent, context-aware AI supervisor.

AI must always know:
- User stage
- Profile completeness
- Shortlisted universities
- Locked university
- Pending tasks
- Current route/page

Behavior:
- Observe silently by default
- Nudge only when useful
- Never interrupt or block UI

Stage-based Behavior:
Stage 1:
- Prompt profile completion
Stage 2:
- Encourage shortlisting
- Prevent premature locking
Stage 3:
- Confirm commitment
- Generate tasks
Stage 4:
- Track tasks
- Suggest next steps

Allowed actions:
- Suggest next step
- Trigger allowed system actions
- Explain blocked actions
