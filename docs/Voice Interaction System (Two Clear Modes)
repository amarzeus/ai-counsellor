Implement TWO distinct voice interaction modes.

-----------------------------------------
MODE 1: Voice Dictation (Utility)
-----------------------------------------
Purpose:
- Replace typing with speech-to-text

Behavior:
- Mic icon inside text input
- Converts speech to text
- Populates input field only
- Message sends ONLY when user clicks Send

Rules:
- No automation
- No AI response triggered automatically
- No PRD logic execution

-----------------------------------------
MODE 2: Voice Conversation Assistant
-----------------------------------------
Purpose:
- Real-time spoken conversation with AI Counsellor

Behavior:
- Separate “Voice Assistant” button
- AI speaks first
- Turn-based (push-to-talk is acceptable)
- AI listens, responds via TTS

Rules:
- Uses SAME AI brain as text
- Enforces ALL PRD rules
- Cannot bypass stages
- Must verbally explain blocked actions
- Must confirm irreversible actions (e.g. locking)

Automation via Voice:
- Update profile from spoken answers
- Move user across stages
- Shortlist universities
- Lock university (with confirmation)
- Create and update tasks

GLOBAL RULES:
- Dictation ≠ Conversation
- Voice ≠ Chat replacement
- Same logic for text and voice
- No duplicate AI systems
